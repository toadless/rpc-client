RPC Client is a basic rpc client that reads from a config file and displays a discord rich presence on your profile. This supports windows, linux and macos.

### Can I Contribute?

Maybe. Feel free to submit PRs, but unless they are explicitly bug fixes that have good and clean code, I likely won't merge. Features will not be accepted through PR unless stated elsewhere. Do not submit feedback on this repository, the server is the right place for that.
